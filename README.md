*Don't want to see the console? Use RWNC to help you!*
## What is RWNC
Run With No Console tool
## How to use
1. Rename your server launcher as **"obr.bat"** or **"obr.exe"**.

2. Put the launcher and RWNC tool in the same folder.

3. Run RWNC

4. Then you can use F12 to hide the console and Pause to show the console.
## Requirements
1. Java 8 or higher (to run the minecraft core)

2. Devcpp 5.6.3 and ptheard (if you want to compile the code)

   Download pthread in ***ftp://sourceware.org/pub/pthreads-win32/prebuilt-dll-2-9-1-release/***  (Open it with explorer or it can be hard to download)

   Or you can just download the RWNC.exe. I've compiled that for you.
