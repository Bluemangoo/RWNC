*Don't want to see the console? Use RWNC to help you!*
## What is RWNC
Run With No Console launcher.
## How to use
1. Put the launcher and RWNC tool in the same folder.

2. Open CMD and do `cd <the folder where RWNC is>`

3. Do `RWNC <command>`

   ***For example: ***
   
   ***To run the minecraft server***
   
   ***Do `RWNC java -Xms256M -Xmx1G` to run the server***

4. Then you can use F12 to hide the console and Pause to show the console.
## Requirements
1. Devcpp 5.6.3 and ptheard (if you want to compile the code).

   Download pthread in ***ftp://sourceware.org/pub/pthreads-win32/prebuilt-dll-2-9-1-release/***  (Open it with explorer or it can be hard to download).

   Or you can just download the RWNC.exe. I've already compiled the code for you.
