# RWNC 2.1.1.1 by bluemangoo
*Don't want to see the console? Use RWNC to help you!*
## What is RWNC
Run With No Console launcher.
## How to use
1. Open CMD and do `cd <the folder where RWNC is>`

2. Do `RWNC <command>`

   ***For example: ***
   
   ***To run the minecraft server***
   
   ***Do `RWNC "java -Xms256M -Xmx1G -jar server.jar"` to run the server***

3. Then you can use F12 to hide the console and Pause to show the console.

Tip: copy RWNC to system32 folder to skip step 1.

   Download pthread in ***ftp://sourceware.org/pub/pthreads-win32/prebuilt-dll-2-9-1-release/***  (Open it with explorer or it can be hard to download).
   
   Lanzous Cloud: ***https://wws.lanzous.com/iAI7pfgtpgb***
